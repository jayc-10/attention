## your attention please ! (or not, but thanks for visiting ü§ç)
in the seventh grade, i read two pages in half an hour. yes, two pages. i found myself re-reading the same lines over and over to where my head hurt and i struggled to reach the reading goals that were once easy for me. years went by and i never knew that this was a common indication of adhd.

despite what could end up being huge workloads, i always found myself procrastinating work and even if i had started early i would still end up finishing my work late. "why didn't i start earlier?" i would tell myself. but at the end of the day, i knew that if i had, it wouldn't have made a difference.

growing up, i've learned of a few techniques that i want to share with others who face similar issues. studying can be difficult and being neurodivergent shouldn't have to hinder our academic success. if anyone hasn't told you this you are capable. you will do great things and i hope this project can be of use or inspire you.

thank you for taking the time to read the inspiration behind this project!

as 2024 comes to an end, i want to express my gratitude to the friends i've met this year for motivating me to pursue my passions: thank you josh, leo, nathan and danny.
